- Binary: two
- Bit: smaller version of a byte -> comes from binary digit 
	- Just 0 or a 1
- Decimal system: dec -> 10

- Videos are pixels that change overtime, a sequence of pictures
- Music, frequency values (duration, how deeper, etc.)

- Car is an abstraction (hide low implementation details)
- Problem solving: input (parameters, arguments) -> algorithm (functions) -> output (side effect, something visual that happens)
- Algorithm: step-by-step instruction for solving some problem
- Event: when something happens
- Arguments and parameters
